					Our Story 
				</h1>
				<p>
					What is the one philosophy that drives SCAAL?
					We believe that no matter where you go, you should
					always be able to enjoy the simple pleasure of a 
					good cup of coffee in a comfortable environment. 
					At home, reading the morning paper. At your local 
					SCAAL, conversing with a confidant. Or perhaps in 
					some foreign land, SCAAL will be greeting you like 
					an old friend. After all, coffee is a ritual that 
					transcends all cultural boundaries. It makes us 
					feel alert, energetic and alive.
				</p>
				<h1>
					Where we began 
				</h1>
				<p>
					Anders Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small 
					fishing village in Marstrand, Sweden. As a 
					child, he listened to stories of his grandfather 
					Olufu's adventures and expeditions. Often his 
					grandfather would bring back exotic coffees for 
					the family to enjoy.  
					Upon his graduation Anders left home to see the 
					world. He worked all kinds of odd jobs. 
					He worked in Parisian cafes and Italian espresso 
					bars. He worked in the coffee fields of Brazil 
					and New Guinea. And in a few years, 
					Anders learned the art of selecting the perfect 
					coffee bean and roasting it to perfection. 

					He returned home in 1980 to open the first 
					SCAAL in Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his 
					own unique blends of coffee and a stimulating 
					atmosphere, SCAAL quickly became the place to 
					gather - day or night - not only in Stockholm, 
					Sweden, but 670 cities around the world. 
				</p>
				<h1>
					What makes SCAAL the best coffee? 
				</h1>
				<p>
					Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned 
					as an apprentice in the coffee fields to every 
					buyer, roaster, and franchise owner. SCAAL's 
					standards for coffee are never compromised. We 
					only select SHB  strictly hard bean or 
					strictly high grown  coffee beans. To 
					ensure their flavorful oils are preserved, 
					extraordinary steps are taken to protect the 
					coffee bean from heat, light, air and moisture. 
					<br>
					<br>
					All these efforts are made so that we may 
					offer you a perfect cup of coffee.
					<br>
					<br>
					There are so many places you could go to 
					buy coffee. We've gone to extraordinary 
					efforts to ensure that SCAAL is your best 
					choice. The quality begins at harvest. SCAAL 
					relies on selective picking, a labor-intensive 
					process that involves making several passes among 
					the trees for those cherries that are perfectly 
					ripe. Then we select top grade SHB, which stands 
					for strictly hard bean or strictly high grown. 
					Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude 
					of 4,000 feet above sea level for optimum 
					flavor. Within hours of shipping our coffee 
					to you, the beans are roasted on-site in small 
					batches by a Certified Roastmaster and vacuum-packed 
					to retain its fresh taste and rich aroma.
